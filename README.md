# A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Event Log Anomaly Detection and Repair

This repository shows an extended version of the Pattern-based Anomaly Reconstruction (PBAR) method [1].

(We are preparing to submit a paper of this extended version to a conference.)

## Prepared Data1 - 5 artificial logs (Small, Medium, Large, Huge, Wide)
We used 5 types of process models including small, medium, large, huge, and wide refered from [2] to generate artificial logs.

## Prepared Data2 - 2 artificial logs (credit-card, mccloud) (named as Credit, Pub in our paper)
We used two process models (credit-card & Pub) refered from [3] to generate artificial logs.

## Prepared Data3 - 2 real-life logs (Road_Traffic, b17)
For the real life logs, we consider (1) the Road Traffic event log which collects events about a road traffic fine management process at a local police authority in Italy and (2) BPIC 2017 which is a benchmard dataset in Process Mining academia.

For all logs, we injected 5 types of anomaly patterns including "insert", "skip", "moved", "replace", and "rework" introduced in [4]. The statistics of datasets are summarised in Table 1 in our paper.

## How To Implement P-BEAR-RL:
- main.py: in terminal, if you run "python main.py --data 'Small' --num_epi 1000 --alpha 0", then you will get a repaired log of the 'Small' data in "~/output" folder.
- pattern_recognition.ipynb: this script will add a prediction of anomalous patterns (i.e., anomalous pattern recognition) to the repaired log in "~/output" folder. Therefore, run this script after you get a result from "main.py".
- see_performance.R : after implementing "pattern_recognition.ipynb", this Rscript summarizes performance (ACC and REC) and save the performance in "~/performance" folder. The entire performance can be see in our paper.

## How To Implement the baselines (Align_TR, Align.ED, DeepAlign):
- For Aligner.TR & Aligner.ED, run ".../alignment/1.implementation_Alignment.py" file, then you will get a repaired log in ".../alignment/result_trd" & "~/alignment/result_edit" folder, respectively.
- For DeepAlign, run ".../DeepAlign/1.implementation_DeepAlign.py" file, then you will get a repaired log in ".../DeepAlign/result" folder. The original code is refered from "https://github.com/tnolle/deepalign".
  
&#x1F53A; Be careful to correctly set your working directory in Python codes and Rscripts.

&#x1F53A; Before running the code, in the folders named as 'normaldata', 'encoded_normal' and 'encoded_anomaly', you may need to put full datasets downloadable in following repository: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y9ZxyqzBGjjiRtgRJfm-O4WWZFSYDG3Q/view?usp=sharing
